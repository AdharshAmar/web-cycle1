 <br> <p> Holi is a Hindu festival that takes place every spring. It's all about new beginnings â€” Holi welcomes the spring season and celebrates the end of winter. The Holi festival always falls on      purnima, or the day of the full moon. It's a two-day holiday; the day before the full moon is Holika Dahan</p>
